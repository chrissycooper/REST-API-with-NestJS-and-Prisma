## Description
I followed [this tutorial](https://www.prisma.io/blog/nestjs-prisma-rest-api-7D056s1BmOL0#assumed-knowledge) to get my feet wet with Prisma, NestJS, and Docker and to strengthen my backend development skills including RESTful API development and familiarity with PostgreSQL. I particularly enjoyed the Swagger documentation tools which made creating interactive API docs a breeze.

I started with this [Nest](https://github.com/nestjs/nest) framework TypeScript starter repository.

## Installation

```bash
$ npm install
```

## Running the app

```bash
# development
$ npm run start

# watch mode
$ npm run start:dev

# production mode
$ npm run start:prod
```
## Preview the App
go to  `localhost:3000/`
to see the Swagger documentation go to `localhost:3000/api`

## Test

```bash
# unit tests
$ npm run test

# e2e tests
$ npm run test:e2e

# test coverage
$ npm run test:cov
```

## Wins and Challenges
A win for this exercise is the beautifully written notes and instructions in this tutorial. At no point was I lost or confused. There were timely explanatory commas for new tools and methods that explained which framework they belonged to. The technical writing was really impressive.

A challenge is that I noticed that I have more to learn about the interactions between the app service and module files and the Prisma module and service files. I might spend some time annotating the repo to really solidify the responsibilities of each part of the application.
